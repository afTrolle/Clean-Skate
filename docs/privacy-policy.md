# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-11-23

This privacy policy is applicable to the **Clean Skate** app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed by **Alexander af Trolle** (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad-Supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".

### 1. Information Collection and Use

**User Provided Information**
The Application does **not** require you to register for an account, log in, or provide your name, email address, or phone number to use the features. The Service Provider does not collect or store personal contact information about you.

**Automatically Collected Information**
When you use the Application, certain information may be collected automatically by the app ecosystem and third-party services. This includes:
*   **Device Information:** The type of mobile device, unique device ID (Advertising ID/IDFA), IP address, and operating system.
*   **Log Data:** In the case of an error or crash, the Application collects data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This may include your device configuration, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
*   **Usage Data:** Information about how you use the Application (Analytics) to help improve the user experience.

### 2. Location Information

**Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?**

The Service Provider **does not** request access to your device's GPS (Fine Location) permissions. We do not independently track your precise real-time location.

However, the Application uses **Google AdMob** to display advertisements. AdMob may use your IP address to determine a coarse (approximate) location (e.g., City or Country level) to serve relevant advertisements, depending on the consent settings you choose.

### 3. Third-Party Access and Data Sharing

The Service Provider does not sell your data. However, to maintain the free nature of the Application, aggregated and anonymized data is transmitted to external services to support advertising and analytics.

The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policies regarding data handling. By using the Application, you acknowledge that data may be processed by:

*   **Google Play Services:** [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
*   **AdMob (Google):** [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)
*   **Google Analytics for Firebase:** [Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
*   **Firebase Crashlytics:** [Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/)

**Legal Disclosure**
The Service Provider may disclose Automatically Collected Information:
*   As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.
*   When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

### 4. European Union Users (GDPR Statement)

Since the Service Provider is based in Sweden, the processing of your data is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Data Controller:** Alexander af Trolle.

**Legal Basis for Processing:**
*   **Legitimate Interest:** For analytics (Firebase) to ensure the app works correctly, identify bugs, and prevent crashes.
*   **Consent:** For personalized advertising (AdMob).

**Your Rights:**
Under the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data. You have the right to **withdraw your consent** for ad tracking at any time. You may do this by accessing the **"Privacy Settings"** or **"Manage Consent"** option within the Application's settings menu.

### 5. United States Users (CCPA/CPRA)

For users residing in California and other US states with similar privacy laws:
The Application does not "sell" personal information in the traditional sense. However, the use of advertising partners (AdMob) may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" of data under California law (CCPA).

You have the right to opt-out of this data sharing. You can exercise this right via the in-app privacy settings (Consent Management Platform) or by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" settings in your device's operating system.

### 6. Children's Privacy

The Service Provider does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. The Application is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without their consent, they should contact the Service Provider at **privacy@cleanskate.com**. The Service Provider will verify and delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

### 7. Opt-Out Rights

You can halt all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace.

To opt out of interest-based advertising, you can adjust your device settings:
*   **Android:** Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization.
*   **iOS:** Settings > Privacy > Tracking.

### 8. Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider retains Automatically Collected information (via third-party analytics) for **up to 14 months**. As the Service Provider does not maintain user accounts, there is no "User Profile" data to delete manually.

### 9. Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. While the Service Provider and third-party partners provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain, please be aware that no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

### 10. Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

### 11. Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at **privacy@cleanskate.com**.
