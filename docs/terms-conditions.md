These terms and conditions apply to the **Clean Skate** app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by **Alexander af Trolle** (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad-Supported service.

Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.

### 1. Intellectual Property
Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

### 2. Scoring Accuracy and Non-Affiliation
**Please Read Carefully:**

*   **Non-Affiliation:** This Application is an independent software project developed by the Service Provider. It is **not** affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with the **International Skating Union (ISU)**, the **International Olympic Committee (IOC)**, or any national figure skating federation. All product and company names are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders. Use of them does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by them.
*   **Informational Purposes Only:** The Application is intended for educational and training purposes only. It is **not** an official scoring system certified by any governing body.
*   **No Guarantee of Accuracy:** While the Service Provider makes a "best effort" to ensure calculations align with current scoring rules (e.g., Scale of Values, GOE tables), the Service Provider **does not guarantee** that the scores generated by the Application will be 100% accurate or match official competition results.
*   **Missing or Incomplete Rules:** You acknowledge that the Application may not support all edge cases, deductions, or complex rule variations. The Application is provided "AS IS," and strict reliance on its output for competition strategy is at your own risk.

### 3. Modifications and Charges
The Service Provider reserves the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.

### 4. Data and Security
The Application collects and processes data (such as Device IDs, usage statistics, and crash logs) to provide the Service, primarily through the third-party services listed below. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

### 5. Third-Party Services and Links
The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. By using the Application, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of these providers:
*   [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
*   [AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob/terms)
*   [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/)
*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

**External Links and Ads:** The Application may contain links to third-party websites or services (via advertisements) that are not owned or controlled by the Service Provider. The Service Provider has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You acknowledge and agree that the Service Provider shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused by your use of any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.

### 6. Connectivity and Data Charges
The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance. If you use the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply, including roaming charges.

### 7. Limitations of Liability (AS IS)
The Application is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service Provider disclaims all liability for:
*   Errors or inaccuracies in score calculations.
*   Any loss or damage resulting from reliance on the Application's data for competitive or professional purposes.
*   Bugs, crashes, or technical failures.

### 8. Updates and Termination
The Service Provider may update the application at any time to ensure compatibility with new operating system versions or updated skating rules. However, the Service Provider does not guarantee that the Application will always reflect the most recent ISU rule changes immediately. The Service Provider may terminate the Application's use at any time without notice.

### 9. Governing Law
These Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the **laws of Sweden**. Any disputes relating to these documents shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden.

### 10. Severability
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Such provisions shall be deleted without affecting the remaining provisions herein.

### 11. Changes to These Terms and Conditions
The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
